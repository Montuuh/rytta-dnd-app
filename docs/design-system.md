# Design system

A quiet field journal: warm paper, forest green, serif headings and readable system-font
body text. Clear hierarchy suits dim tables and short mobile visits. This shell is the
foundation, not final design approval for every gameplay screen.

## Appearance and language

Dark is the first-visit default, regardless of the OS preference. The warm hearth palette
uses background #140F0B, surface #1E1610, raised surface #2A1F16, warm cream text #F5EBD6,
secondary sand text #CBB699 and amber/orange accents #EDA145. Warm gold #F6C478 is the focus
indicator. Filled amber controls use deep espresso text #181009, including their hover state.

Light mode uses warm parchment #F7EFE2, surface #FFFDF9, text #2A1C11, secondary text #664F3A
and roasted chestnut accents (#6E3410 for primary buttons). Focus uses #844112. Both palettes
preserve the same hierarchy; the palette is a product choice verified with contrast tests.

Semantic tokens live in src/app/styles.css and feed Mantine variables. Avoid hardcoded
light backgrounds or white text on pale dark-mode accents. The header uses a stacked two-row
layout without a left sidebar: Row 1 shows the logo, RYTTA brand and campaign name on the left,
and right-aligned DM Player POV, direct ES/EN language toggle, direct dark/light theme toggle
and a unified Profile menu (My campaigns, App setup, Sign out). Row 2 shows module navigation
as a horizontal scrollable row of tabs. Campaign home has no duplicate account/logout block.
All controls have 44px targets. Preferences persist locally and remain usable in memory if
storage is blocked.

Spanish is the first-visit language even on English browsers. English is selectable.
Use src/shared/i18n catalogs and typed keys for visible text, accessible names, loading,
empty/error states and route titles. Update the document language. Never machine-translate
user campaign content. Sample campaign copy is localized because it is application-owned.

Mantine is the single component kit: accessible dialogs/drawers, forms, menus, tabs,
notifications and layout. Lucide supplies icons. Reuse official patterns rather than
maintaining duplicate widgets or adding Tailwind/shadcn alongside Mantine.

Theme tokens: src/app/theme.ts. Layout: src/app/styles.css. Keep campaign art optional;
the compass is decorative. Self-host future fonts and document licenses.

## Interaction

- Prioritize glanceable resources and the next useful action.
- Minimum 44px touch targets; essential information cannot depend on hover.
- Focus trapping, Escape and return focus for overlays; focus content on navigation.
- Preserve reduced motion, text zoom, landmarks and heading hierarchy.
- Show loading, empty, error, forbidden, stale and offline states where relevant.
- No fake mutations. Planned screens clearly say they are planned.
- WCAG AA contrast; never convey roles/status by color alone.

## Verification

Playwright covers 1440px desktop, 820px tablet and a 390px touch phone profile.
Inspect captures and exercise keyboard, drawer/Escape, direct links, 150% text and reduced motion.
Axe supplements visual/touch review; mobile Chromium emulation does not verify iOS Safari.
Every interface change requires the independent ui-ux verdict described in [UI review](ui-review.md).
